System Requirements
-------------------
This plugin has been developed for OJS 3.1.2 and may not work with other
versions.

Installation
------------
This plugin is probably available for quick installation in the OJS Plugin
Gallery. To install it there, go to Settings > Website > Plugins and open the
Plugin Gallery.

If you cannot use the Plugin Gallery, you can also install the plugin as follows:
 - Using the Journal Manager's "system plugins" area, upload the plugin .tar.gz
   file into OJS.
 - as Journal Manager, go into the "System Plugins" page and enable the plugin.
 - Read an HTML article in the public reader interface of OJS and verify that
   the Hypothes.is tool is embedded.

In order to support Hypothes.is with OJS's PDF.js-based PDF reader, this plugin
hijacks the template display of the pdfJsViewer plugin.
